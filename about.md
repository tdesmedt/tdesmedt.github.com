I am Tom De Smedt, a PhD researcher at the <a href="http://www.wiv-isp.be/">Scientific Institute of Public Health Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>.

I completed my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering at <a href="http://www.ugent.be/">Ghent University</a> in June 2012. I have since been a part of the department of Health and Environment at the Scientific Institute of Public Health Belgium. My PhD research focusses on developing novel statistical methods and generic tools for spatial analyses in environmental epidemiology. I have developed a method for taking within-area variation of the exposure into account in the regression method for ecological studies resulting in the alleviation of ecological bias. I have also been involved in the statistical analysis of the biomonitoring study in the aftermath of the train accident in Wetteren, Belgium as a main contributor.

My professional curriculum vitae can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV_DE_SMEDT_Tom.pdf), my software projects are accessible through <a href="https://github.com/tdesmedt/">my GitHub</a>

I enjoy watching all American sports, playing football and eating good food.
