First post
========================================================

Hi! On this blog I will be primarily posting about my work in [R](http://www.r-project.org/), but also about other research topics and personal rants on all kinds of topics. As indicated in the [Academic page]({{site.url/}}academic/), my interests lie in ecological studies in environmental epidemiology and data visualisation techniques. This blog will also serve as a mnemonic tool for my programming routines I tend to forget. My recent endeavours had me exploring the use of ggplot2 for publication-ready graphics, especially focussing on the mapping capabilities. I intend to make a thorough comparison with javascript libraries focussed on graphics, such as d3, in the near future. On a more personal note I have recently been trying to use R as a purely functional programming language.
